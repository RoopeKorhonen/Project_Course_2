1.) Employing a Localization Method:

The strategy adopts a localization method to accommodate diverse languages within the application. It loads resource bundles tailored to the chosen language and adjusts the user interface components (such as labels, buttons, etc.) accordingly.

2.) Database Localization Strategy:

The database localization aspect encompasses segregating localized data into distinct tables based on the chosen language. For instance, the application establishes tables like employee_english, employee_farsi, and employee_japanese to house employee data in various languages.

3.) Encoding Characters:
To ensure seamless handling of Unicode characters, the solution configures the character encoding for the database connection as UTF-8 (characterEncoding=UTF-8 in the database URL). This guarantees accurate storage and retrieval of characters across different languages.

4.) Data Storage Methodology:
During data storage, the application dynamically selects the table name based on the chosen language and inserts the data into the corresponding table. This ensures that the data is stored in the appropriate language-specific table.

In essence, the solution adeptly integrates localization into the application by accommodating multiple languages and storing localized data within the database. It exemplifies a pragmatic approach to address localization complexities in a JavaFX application.
